## About Irish Fitness
   Irish Fitness is a web application that allows students, faculty, and staff to better lead healthy lives on campus. We allow users to track basic health information, build nutritious meals from various Campus Dining locations, and plan productive workouts in on-campus gyms. There are features to view daily menus, select exercises that are viable with limited exercise equipment in some gyms, and the ability to draw running routes on a map of campus.
  Our target audience includes Notre Dame students and faculty interested in leading a healthy lifestyle while on campus. Similar fitness websites exist (eg. MyFitnessPal), but these apps do not work well with Campus Dining menus and limited availability of workout equipment on campus. Irish Fitness seeks to bridge the gap between Notre Dame and fitness tracking. Our project is useful because it allows this audience to track their lifestyle and make consistent improvements to better their health.

## Functionality 


## Further Development
- Due to our webapp being hosted on a Notre Dame server, it can only be accessed from the Notre Dame network. We could spin up MySQL and Apache servers for this website to be run independently.
- Users should be able to save their running-route drawings and view them all in one place.
